[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/d70dc243-57d5-4d25-8ac2-74a0fe5fdd51/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/practical-einstein-d90e91/deploys)

My website built with [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) + [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) + [Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss) and deployied using [Netflify](https://www.netlify.com/).

For now this website is very simple, and I aim to implements other features on other pages to showcase my skills.

# About the app

> I use `pnpm` for dependency management, for reducing the size of my node modules across multiple projects.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
